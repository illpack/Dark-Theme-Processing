I created this theme for sensitive eyes. I just made some adjustments to preferences.txt and theme.txt, and modified the most used logos.
Note that this is a BETA version, and not all logos migh work. Feel free to report any bugs and submit suggestions. 
All files can be dl from here:

I hope you like it! Enjoy ;)

INSTALLATION:

Before subsituting any folders, make a copy of the originals so you can always come back to the default presets. 

1./ Download the files
2./ Copy and substitute the file 'theme.txt' and the folders 'footer', 'toolbar' and 'status' to your processing's 'lib' folder 
    (normally under your Processing's route, in my case: C:\processing-3.0.1\lib)
3./ Copy and substitute the file 'preferences.txt' >> the folder containing this file can be accessed 
    by opening Processing, clicking File>Preferences and clicking in the link in the inferior part of the panel. 
    Normally C:\Users\----\AppData\Roaming\Processing
4./ Enjoy!
